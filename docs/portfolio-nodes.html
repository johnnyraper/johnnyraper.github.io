            <h2>Product Design for Nodes &amp; Links</h2>

            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
              Nodes &amp; Links is a technology company that works with global leaders in the
              project delivery space, from energy and construction to aerospace and defence. Their
              AI platform help teams access critical project knowledge fast and easy. As a result,
              projects are delivered faster, more sustainably, and at less cost.
            </p>

            <p>
              I joined Nodes &amp; Links in January 2022 and worked on their in-house B2B SaaS
              software product, where I:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Interviewed industry Risk experts to elicit existing product shortcomings and
                devised appropriate strategies for task prioritisation with a Product Owner and the
                Head of Product.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gathered requirements for data-heavy screens and made suggestions for improvement,
                as well as implemented wireframes and designs according to my user research.
              </li>
              <li>
                Created high fidelity, visually compelling and polished designs using Figma to
                present ideas and user flows.
              </li>
              <li>
                Created rapid prototypes to ensure ideas are iterated through quickly, whilst
                maintaining a clear focus on channelling effective ideas in line with task story
                pointing and sprint deadlines.
              </li>
              <li>
                Designed a suite of components accompanied with behaviours and interactions in the
                form of a Design System, which was constantly maintained and integrated with
                Storybook.
              </li>
              <li>
                Worked across: Quantitative Schedule Risk Analysis (QSRA), Risk Drivers, Milestone
                Trend Analysis, Multi-Factor Authentication and Resources.
              </li>
              <li>...and more!</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Work examples</h3>

                >Unfortunately, I cannot show the work I did at Nodes &amp; Links as it's private
                and confidential. However, my main job functions were as follows:</strong
              >
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Created a colour palette library.</li>
              <li>Published this library for reuse among all future Figma projects.</li>
              <li>Created a Design System (please see images below).</li>
              <li>
                Created videos and how-to's for developers regarding component use cases (we were a
                fully remote team).
              </li>
              <li>Led the design offering of the company, improving upon existing screens.</li>
              <li>Mentored a junior designer, working in a Design team of three.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="u-reading">
            <h3>Design System and Component Library</h3>
            <p>
              I created a mixture of single and multi-variant components, each with annotations that
              were presented to the development team instructing them on the intended use cases. To
              iron out any ambiguities, I also recorded short videos explaining the components in
              silo and in situ within the wider context of a product screen.
            </p>

            <p>
              I worked with the development team to help integrate Storybook and Chromatic into our
              day-to-day workflows, which made it easier to implement component iterations
              seamlessly.
            </p>

            <p>
              Below are some examples of these components, but unfortunately I cannot show these in
              situ due to confidentiality reasons.

          <div class="u-reading">
            <p>
              As the Senior Product Designer, I reported directly into the Head of Product. The
              overall team was comprised of 15&ndash;20 Software Engineers as well as Data
              Scientists, distributed across two squads. A Product Manager managed a squad each. As
              a designer, I worked directly with a Product Manager and Software Engineers, in an
              Agile fashion. We had stand-ups to times per week, where each sprint lasted for two
              weeks, top and tailed with sprint grooming and retrospectives.
            </p>

            <h3>Process and methodology</h3>

            <p>
              My role at Nodes &amp; Links was largely around designing visually appealing screens
              for Project Risk, as well as Risk Drivers
              <em>(what is the reason for this risk occurring)</em>, Milestone Trend Analysis
              <em>(plotting project milestones and activities on a grid)</em>, Multi-Factor
              Authentication and Resources
              <em
                >(project resources: equipment such as cranes, JCBs and their usage as well as
                material procurement such as cement)</em
              >.
            </p>

            <p>
              Around Risk, I came up with design ideas for how to improve the existing Risk Analysis
              screens, and redesigned the Risk Table, Risk Register and Risk Template screens.
            </p>

            <h3>UX design</h3>

            <p>
              On the UX research side, this involved scheduling meetings with existing clients of
              the company, where I understood what they liked and found useful as well as what their
              pain points were. I also consulted industry risk experts to ascertain their objective
              views on the existing Risk pages, which qualitatively and quantitatively drove part of
              the project redesign.
            </p>

            <h3>UI design</h3>

            <p>
              Whilst I am unable to show final screen designs, I can paint a picture for you: Nodes
              &amp; Links had no Product Designers when myself and the junior designer joined the
              company. I was tasked with designing the more complex screens, where I established
              foundations such as: working to an 8px grid, consistent iconography, a reusable page
              template that was intended to satisy the bulk of the pages, and just generally tidying
              up, streamlining and making the product look more sparkly.
            </p>
