            <p>
              I enjoy projects with ambition, where I can be a nimble team player who can truly make
              an impact. I've designed and developed unique digital experiences across prestigious
              companies in B2B, B2C and DTC spaces.

            <p>
              Originally hailing from Lincolnshire with a move to London in 2008, I have a
              background in computing visualisation, 2D and 3D graphics. I'm a seasoned and dynamic
              experience designer with an eagle eye for detail, who blends a palette of strong
              design skills with clean, semantic code to create memorable encounters.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spanning well over a decade's experience, I have worked with clients such as:
              Microsoft, CloudNC, Rafinex, Knight Frank, The Premier League and Richard E. Grant.
              I'm reliable and efficient, and I bring innovative technological skills to creative
              teams. My tools of the trade include Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD and the Adobe Creative
              Suite (primarily Photoshop and Illustrator). Additionally I use VS Code for building
              frontends.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've helped many successful brands create beautiful solutions for their customers, and
              have spent the last five of 12 years producing compelling user interfaces for
              technology startups, scaleups, digital agencies as well as large corporations.
            </p>

            <h3>Process summary</h3>
            <p>
              I'm a multidisciplinary product designer, and work end-to-end spanning some/all of the
              stages of UX, UI and on occasion, frontend development. I analyse competitors to
              identify industry trends and understand the positive and negative areas of existing
              products. Often I find customers have a set idea of what they require, so I work with
              relevant stakeholders to ascertain initial requirements, elicit these into acceptance
              criterion with estimations for each task. I begin by generating low-fidelity
              wireframes, user flows, mockups and prototypes, and we're underway.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, if requirements are either lacking, ambiguous or unclear, I will work with
              stakeholders (usually the customer/team, developers, and a Product Owner(s)) to
              further understand the problem, and generate the required wireframes, mockups, etc. in
              accordance with their needs. Through undertaking design iterations, I'm able to turn
              ambiguous requirements into intuitive solutions, which delights users and exceeds
              expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
              I ensure ideas are always communicated clearly to all parties, leading to the build
              and delivery of a functional, intuitive and beautiful product.
            </p>

            <h3>Disciplines</h3>
            <p>
              I have honed my skills across many areas of design, technology and marketing. These
              include:
