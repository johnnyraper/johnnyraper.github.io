          <h1>Design is my passion</h1>
          <p>
            I enjoy projects with ambition and a difficult problem to solve. I've designed and
            developed unique digital experiences across prestigious companies in the B2B and B2C spaces.

          <p>
            With a background in computing visualisation, 2D and 3D graphics, I'm a seasoned and
            dynamic experience designer with an eagle eye for detail. I blend a palette of strong
            design skills with clean, semantic code to create memorable encounters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spanning well over a decade's experience, I've worked with clients such as: Microsoft, CloudNC, Rafinex,
            Knight Frank, The Premier League and Richard E. Grant. I'm reliable and efficient, and
            I bring innovative technological skills to creative teams. My tools of the trade
            include Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD and the Adobe Creative Suite (primarily Photoshop and Illustrator).
            Additionally I use VS Code for building frontends.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've helped many successful brands create beautiful solutions for their customers, and
            have spent the last five of 12 years producing compelling user interfaces in the fields
            of SaaS B2B and B2C &ndash; to that I remain consciously interested and excited.
          </p>

          <h3>Process summary</h3>
          <p>I'm a multidisciplinary product designer, and work end-to-end spanning some/all of the stages of UX, UI and
            frontend development. I analyse competitors to identify industry trends and understand the positive and
            negative areas of existing products. Often I find customers have a set idea of what they require, so I work
            with relevant stakeholders to ascertain initial requirements, elicit these into acceptance criterion with
            estimations for each task. I begin by generating low-fidelity wireframes, user flows, mockups and
            prototypes, and we're underway.</p>
          <p>However, if requirements are either lacking, ambiguous or unclear, I will work with stakeholders (usually
            the customer/team, developers, and a Product Owner(s)) to further understand the problem, and generate the
            required wireframes, mockups, etc. in accordance with their needs.</p>
          <p>Once feedback is generated and iterated on, I make high-fidelity wireframes leading to the creation of UI
            designs. I ensure ideas are always communicated clearly to all parties, leading to the build and delivery of
            a functional, intuitive and beautiful product.</p>

          <h3>Disciplines</h3>
          <p>I have honed my skills across many areas of design, technology and marketing. These include:</p>
          <ul class="disciplines">
