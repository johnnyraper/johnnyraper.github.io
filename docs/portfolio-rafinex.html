            <h3>UX Design</h3>
            <p>
              As the lead UX/UI designer at Rafinex, I collaborated with the holistic team to
              understand and overhaul the existing "proof of concept" platform for its market
              release. With prior experience in product design, I created an intuitive product that
              was targeted specifically for its target audience. I analysed similar Finite Element
              Analysis (FEA) products to understand UI design and functionality within this specific
              domain. I performed tasks using OnScale Solve and SimScale to deepen my understanding
              and read FEA whitepapers to help inform UI decisions.
            </p>

            <p>During my research, I learnt the following:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Existing industry packages feel antiquated, despite being functionally rich and
                comprehensive.
              </li>
              <li>
                They are poorly designed from a UX perspective, making functions hard to find and
                basic tasks cumbersome.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p class="portfolio__callout">
              I aimed to create a beautiful, user-centric design that combined technical
              functionality, while fulfilling a business need for a modern software application.
            </p>

            <p>
              I interviewed internal stakeholders to determine new product requirements for the
              typical user persona (an advanced engineer). I compiled this information and used it
              to create initial requirements for UX wireframes, after summarising key topics into a
              spreadsheet.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="u-reading">
            <p>
              I created low-fidelity wireframes based on the CTO's technical schema to conceptualise
              elements, panels, and dialogues before advancing to high-fidelity designs.
            </p>

            <p>
              I chose a table layout for the <em>All Simulations</em> view to handle the extensive
              information per simulation. The need for filters also made tables ideal for easily
              adding and removing rows.
            </p>

            <p>These wireframes are set out as below:</p>

              Engineers need to work fast and efficiently. Every second of time is crucial; the need
              to produce results quickly is essential. Therefore aesthetical transitions would be
              used sparingly, to enable rapid progression through a task&mdash;particularly when
              most tasks are repetitive.

            <p>
              For <em>Import Geometry</em> I designed a drag-and-drop interface for easy STEP file

            <h3>UI Design and Design System</h3>
            <p>
              I established a cohesive design system ensuring consistent aesthetics and brand
              alignment across all screens. This included colour palettes, typography, form
              components, and layout rules for development. Rafinex's primary blue remained
              prominent, complemented by a secondary color. I also defined tones for user feedback
              states: <em>information</em>, <em>success</em>, <em>warning</em> and <em>error</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ensuring visual clarity, I opted for opaque colours to avoid opacity-related issues
              during implementation.

              High-fidelity wireframes from the UX stage facilitated the strategic application of
              color in the <em>All Simulations</em> listing. Due to the table's complexity and
              importance in workflow screens, I focused on a minimalist and contemporary interface.
              For this approach, I utilised subtle splashes of color, legible typefaces, and an 8px
              uniform grid for enhanced readability and spacing.

              For the core application workflow, I opted to place the main user controls within two
              vertically scrollable panels. Given that I wanted to dedicate most of the space to the
              3D model area, where an engineer would spend most of his/her time, it was crucial for
              these menus to be compact yet easily accessible.
            </p>

            <p>
              Each accordion on the left opens an adjacent context menu with specific controls.
              Users can perform tasks like defining sets (one or multiple surfaces) for their 3D
              model, applying forces, defining mesh properties and viewing optimised topology
              results.

              developed reusable, modular components using the BEM (Block Element Modifier) class
              naming convention. This approach ensures semantic naming and reduces the risk of class
              naming conflicts within the codebase.
            </p>

            <p>
              As of today, some features are currently being developed such as the central toolbar
