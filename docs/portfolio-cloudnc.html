            <h2>Website Development, Software UI Design and Development : CloudNC</h2>

            <h3>Intro</h3>

            <p>
              CloudNC automates the CNC manufacturing process using automatic toolpath generation,
              enabling high-volume production and global shipping. In streamlining this process,
              thousands of human hours are saved.
            </p>

            <p>
              I joined CloudNC on a three-month contract in January 2018 to rebuild their website,
              which was housed in a monorepo with their Autonomous Machining Technology (AMT)
              software. At the end of the contract, I received positive feedback from the frontend
              lead and was offered a permanent position on the technology team.
            </p>

            <h3>Product Team</h3>

            <p>
              I worked in an agile team of six frontend developers and one UX designer, within a
              15-engineer full stack team. We had two-week sprints, reporting to the Software
              Development Team Lead and Head of Product, managed by the VP of Engineering. Using
              JIRA, we conducted daily stand-ups, fortnightly sprint planning, backlog grooming and
              retrospectives. Tasks were sized using the Fibonacci sequence to measure progress
              against a burndown chart.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Achievements</h3>

            <p>My role at CloudNC encompassed three major rebranding exercises:</p>

            <h3>1. Website Development for Series A Fundraising</h3>

            <p>
              To meet a critical need and an external deadline, I worked with one other person to
              design and build a responsive, optimised website for CloudNC's Series A fundraising. I
              created mobile, tablet and desktop designs as well as wrote modular HTML and Sass
              within Angular components for CloudNC's brand website, learning Angular component
              building, Angular Material, and styling techniques. I ensured best coding practices
              and attention to detail throughout.
            </p>

          <div class="u-reading">
            <h3>2. B2B SaaS: AMT Software Design and Development</h3>
            <p>
              The AMT software is a multi-level, interactive and highly sophisticated CNC machining
              simulator, g-code generator and tooling library. Integrated with complex mathematical
              toolpath generation, it takes a 3D file and displays the most efficient toolpaths with
              the specialized cutting tools needed for manufacturing.
            </p>

            <p>
              CNC Machinists use this software to generate a setup sheet detailing tool
              requirements, specifications, and machining times.
            </p>

            <p>
              I undertook UI design and theming within the software, ensuring design elements were
              clean and user flows were intuitive.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="u-reading">
            <h3>Setup Sheet Redesign</h3>
            <p>
              A Setup Sheet guides CNC Machinists on the part being produced, required tools, and
              estimated machining time. During usability testing, I learnt that the inaugural Sheet
              lacked key information, was poorly designed and its layout was confusing.
            </p>

            <p>
              Taking on the role of UX Designer for this project, I iterated on digital and printed
              templates, improving clarity and logical presentation. The redesigned Setup Sheet was
              well received for saving time and presenting information more clearly.
            </p>

          <div class="u-reading">
            <h3>3. UX, UI Design and Project Management for the Digital Production Dashboard</h3>
            <p>
              The Operations team needed a real-time dashboard displaying current jobs across work
              centres (machines or specific job sites) including procurement, quality control, and
              machine operations. The dashboard, shown on a TV screen, monitored work centre
              statuses, machining progress and uptime/downtime, capacity, material procurement and
              planning.
            </p>

            <p>
              I project managed the design and implementation from start to finish, coordinating
              with stakeholders and ensured that deadlines were met, in line with business
              priorities.
            </p>

            <p>
              In my research, I found there are 48 work centres. Displaying all of thse on one
              screen seemed impractical, so I opted for two views of 24 centres each, organised in
              an eight-column grid, with each column containing up to three centres.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h3>Design Ideas</h3>
            <p>
              My initial designs used colors matching the AMT software's UI, as requested by the
              Operations team. Colours indicated machine status, with clear job/part information
              displayed.
            </p>
          </div>

          <img class="portfolio__article-image" src="assets/cloudnc/dpd-design-ideas.png" alt="" />

          <div class="u-reading">
            <p>
              The initial design was mostly liked but needed adjustments, particularly the doughnut
              graph, to meet updated requirements. It now shows <em>quantity made</em> in blue,
              <em>quantity remaining</em> in orange, and <em>total quantity</em> as a white outline.
            </p>
          </div>

          <img

            alt=""
          />

          <div class="u-reading">
            <p>
              The single work centre design was well received by the Operations team, who approved
              it for implementation. It has proven highly effective in monitoring work centre
              activity and behaviors, enabling factory employees to work more efficiently.
