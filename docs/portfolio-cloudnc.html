            <h2>Website Development, Software UI Design and Development : CloudNC</h2>

            <h3>Intro</h3>

            <p>
              CloudNC automate the end-to-end manufacturing process and utilise automatic toolpath
              generation techniques, enabling high volumes of parts to be produced and shipped
              worldwide, saving thousands of human hours in the process.
            </p>

            <p>
              I joined CloudNC on a three-month contract in January 2018, and was tasked to rebuild
              their existing website, which was housed in a monorepo together with their Autonomous
              Machining Technology (AMT) software.
            </p>

            <p>
              Towards the end of the contract, I received extremely positive feedback from the
              frontend team lead and was offered the opportunity to join their technology team
              permanently.
            </p>

            <h3>Process and Methodology</h3>

            <p>
              I worked in an agile technology team of six frontend developers and one UX designer,
              which was part of a wider "full stack" team of around 15 engineers in total.
            </p>

            <p>
              I worked in sprints lasting two weeks, reporting to a Software Development Team Lead
              and Head of Product, and the team was managed by the VP of Engineering. We used JIRA
              to manage tasks end-to-end and held sprint planning meetings, backlog grooming
              sessions and retrospectives fortnightly, and stand-ups daily. The Fibonacci sequence
              was adopted to size tasks accordingly, which helped to accurately measure each
              sprint's progress against a burndown chart.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Projects</h3>

            <p>My role at CloudNC encompassed three major rebranding exercises:</p>

            <h3>1. Website Development</h3>

            <p>
              In fulfilling a business critical need and working to an externally imposed deadline,
              I worked in a team of two and built a responsive, optimised and semantic website to
              aid CloudNC in their Series A fundraising journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              Within the context of Angular components, I wrote modularised HTML and Sass for
              CloudNC's customer-facing brand website (no longer publicly visible). Contained as
              part of a broader Angular application, this involved a learning curve of Angular
              component building and modification, Angular Material (Material Design component and
              theming library) and how to approach global and view encapsulated styles within the
              context of modular components. I ensured best coding practices were followed with due
              attention to detail.

            <h3>2. AMT Software Design and Development</h3>
            <p>
              The AMT software is many things, but for all intents and purposes it is a multi-level,
              interactive and highly sophisticated CNC machining simulator, g-code generator and
              tooling library. Integrated with a complex backend of mathematical toolpath
              generation, it takes a 3D file and graphically displays a series of toolpaths in
              combination with the specialised cutting tools needed to manufacture a part. These
              toolpaths are derived as the fastest and most efficient from millions of possible
              permutations.
            </p>

            <p>
              CNC Machinists use this software to generate a setup sheet (more information below)
              which in turn provides them key information such as the physical tools needed for a
              particular job, tool specifications and the estimate time per machining operation.
            </p>
            <p>I was responsible for the UI design and its application in theming the software.</p>
          </div>

          <img class="portfolio__article-image" src="assets/cloudnc/amt-ui-main.png" alt="" />

          <div class="u-reading">
            <h3>Setup Sheet</h3>
            <p>
              A setup sheet is a document which instructs the CNC Machinist what part they are
              producing, the tools needed and the estimated time the job will take to run. In
              ascertaining feedback from the machinisits I learnt that the initial setup sheet
              lacked key information, was poorly designed and its layout was confusing.
            </p>

            <p>
              I worked closely with the UX designer to come up with new designs for both the digital
              and printed setup sheet templates. These underwent a few rounds of iterations before
              being implemented within the AMT software interface.
            </p>

            <p>
              The redesigned setup sheet was very well received by Machinists: it served as a time
              saver on a per job basis, being easier to understand with key information presented in
              the most logical order.

            <h3>3. Digital Production Dashboard</h3>
            <p>
              The factory based Operations team required a dashboard display of all current jobs
              (work centres), which continually updated in real time, as production jobs were queued
              and flowed through the factory floor. A production job could be: procurement, quality
              control or indeed a machine itself. Information was to be displayed on a television
              screen, used as a source of reference to monitor work centre statuses, ascertain
              machining status and capacity, plan for procurement of materials and separately,
              evaluate uptime and downtime of machinery.
            </p>

            <p>
              I was responsible for project managing this piece of work end-to-end, ensuring
              internal deadlines were met and liaising with the relevant stakeholders. It was my
              duty to collaborate with the Operations Associate to ascertain and understand deeply
              all of the requirements of this project so that they could be prioritised.
            </p>

            <h3>UX Design</h3>

            <p>
              During my research I determined that there are 48 work centres in total. Given the
              information to be displayed per work centre, my perception was that it would prove too
              difficult to arrange 48 work centres on a single screen. Subsequently, it made sense
              to alternate periodically between two views (24 work centres per view). I maintained a
              thought that this seemed unachievable, although it was without doubt more viable.
            </p>

            <p>
              This led me to create a wireframe divided into eight columns, whereby each column
              would contain a maximum of three work centres.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="u-reading">
            <h3>UI design</h3>
            <p>
              The first design ideas I came up with were colour coded to match the UI design of the
              AMT software. This was a desired requirement from the Operations team, and so it made
              sense to reproduce a similar style. Colours were indicative of machine status, and
              job/part information was displayed.
            </p>
          </div>

          <img class="portfolio__article-image" src="assets/cloudnc/dpd-design-ideas.png" alt="" />

          <div class="u-reading">
            <p>
              While the initial design was mostly well received, it wasn't quite workable in that
              the doughnut graph needed redesigning due to amended requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
              As well as <em>quantity made</em> and <em>quantity remain</em> it needed to also show
              <em>quantity total</em>. After some ideas and sketches around how best to illustrate
              this data, I came up with the following design, whereby: <em>quantity made</em> is
              represented by the blue zone, <em>quantity remaining</em> orange, and
              <em>quantity total</em> shown as the white outline.
            </p>
          </div>

          <img
            class="portfolio__article-image"
            src="assets/cloudnc/dpd-design-adjusted.png"
            alt=""
          />

          <div class="u-reading">
            <p>
              This design of a single work centre was widely appreciated and the Operations
              Associate and his team were happy to proceed. An example of the finalised design is
              shown below. This was extremely well received by the Operations team and serves as a
              useful aid in monitoring work centre activity, monitoring behaviours as well as
              enabling factory employees to carry out their job more effectively.
