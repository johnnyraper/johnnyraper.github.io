            <h2>Product Design : Nodes &amp; Links</h2>

            <h3>Intro</h3>

            <p>
              Nodes &amp; Links is a technology company partnering with global leaders in project
              delivery across energy, construction, aerospace, and defence. Their AI platform
              enables teams to quickly access critical project knowledge, resulting in faster, more
              sustainable, and cost-effective project delivery.
            </p>

            <p>
              I joined Nodes &amp; Links in January 2022, working on their in-house B2B SaaS
              product. My key contributions included:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Interviewing industry risk experts to identify product shortcomings and devising
                strategies for task prioritisation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gathering requirements for data-heavy screens, suggesting improvements, and
                implementing wireframes and designs based on user research.
              </li>
              <li>
                Creating high-fidelity, polished designs in Figma to present ideas and user flows.
              </li>
              <li>
                Creating rapid prototypes for quick iteration, ensuring alignment with task story
                pointing and sprint deadlines.
              </li>
              <li>
                Creating a Design System with components, colors, typography, and form elements, all
                aligned with the evolving brand style, to which I devised.
              </li>
              <li>
                Designing a comprehensive suite of components with behaviours and interactions,
                maintaining and integrating them into a Design System with Notion and Storybook.
              </li>
              <li>
                I worked on projects including Quantitative Schedule Risk Analysis (QSRA), Risk
                Drivers, Milestone Trend Analysis, Multi-Factor Authentication, and Resources.
              </li>
            </ul>

            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Created a colour palette library.</li>
              <li>Published this library for reuse among all future Figma projects.</li>
              <li>Created a Design System (please see images below).</li>
              <li>
                Created videos and how-to's for developers regarding component use cases (we were a
                fully remote team).
              </li>
              <li>Led the design offering of the company, improving upon existing screens.</li>
              <li>Mentored a junior designer.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="u-reading">
            <h3>Design System and Component Library</h3>
            <p>
              I created and annotated single and multi-variant components for the development team,
              explaining their use cases. To clarify any ambiguities, I recorded short videos
              detailing the components both individually and within product screens.
            </p>

            <p>
              I collaborated with the development team to integrate Storybook and Chromatic into our
              workflows, facilitating seamless component iterations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Below are examples of these components; however, I cannot show them in situ due to
              confidentiality.

          <div class="u-reading">
            <p>
              As the Senior Product Designer, I reported directly to the Head of Product. Our team
              included 15&ndash;20 Software Engineers and Data Scientists, divided into two squads,
              each managed by a Product Manager. I worked closely with a Product Manager and
              Software Engineers in an Agile environment. We held stand-ups twice a week, with
              two-week sprints bookended by sprint grooming and retrospectives.
            </p>

            <h3>Process and Methodology</h3>

            <p>
              At Nodes &amp; Links, my role focused on designing visually appealing screens for
              Project Risk, Risk Drivers (identifying reasons for risks), Milestone Trend Analysis
              (plotting project milestones on a grid), Multi-Factor Authentication, and Resources
              (managing project equipment and material procurement).
            </p>

            <p>
              For Risk, I developed design improvements for existing Risk Analysis screens and
              redesigned the Risk Table, Risk Register, and Risk Template screens.
            </p>

            <h3>UX Design</h3>

            <p>
              On the UX research side, I scheduled meetings with existing clients to understand
              their likes, useful features, and pain points. I also consulted industry risk experts
              to gather objective views on the existing Risk pages, which qualitatively and
              quantitatively guided the project redesign.
            </p>

            <h3>UI Design</h3>

            <p>
              While I can't show the final screen designs, I can describe my work at Nodes &amp;
              Links. When the junior designer and I joined, there were no Product Designers. I
              focused on designing complex screens, establishing foundations like an 8px grid,
              consistent iconography, a reusable page template for most pages, and overall tidying
              up and streamlining the product to enhance its visual appeal.
            </p>
