            <h2>Product discovery, UX, UI design and development : Rafinex Möbius</h2>

            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
              Rafinex's SaaS product, Möbius, is the most advanced topology optimisation technology
              on the market. Möbius generates robust, reliable and safe components in
              high-performance industries that are fit for reality and remain safe.
            </p>

            <h3>UX design</h3>
            <p>
              As the sole UX/UI designer, I worked exclusively with the CTO and understood the
              existing product platform, its features and what needed to be overhauled for the first
              release to market. With experience in product design and development in my previous
              role, I relished the challenge of spearheading the user interface design for this
              product.
            </p>

            <p>
              My first foray into the world of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) involved analysing
              similar products and drawing conclusions from these in their approach to user
              interface design, level of intuition and functionality.
            </p>

            <p>Two things immediately struck me:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                There is a common theme of existing packages in the industry, which feel antiquated.
              </li>
              <li>
                Most packages are functionally rich, performant and comprehensive, yet are poorly
                designed.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p class="portfolio__callout">
              I was passionate about creating something beautiful, organic and user-centric. I
              realised the importance of combining technical functionality while fulfilling the
              business need for a modern software application.
            </p>

            <p>
              I conducted user interviews with relevant internal stakeholders to ascertain new
              product requirements for the typical user persona (an advanced engineer). I then
              collated this information into a report, and drew the key topics into a spreadsheet.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="u-reading">
            <p>
              Following the discovery phase, I took information from the CTO to create high-fidelity
              wireframes and produced an interactive prototype.
            </p>

            <p>
              I elected to use a table layout for the <em>All Simulations</em> view due to the high
              level of information required per simulation. The additional requirement of filters
              also led to a conscious decision to display data in a table, given that filtered table
              rows can be added and removed easily.

          <div class="u-reading">
            <p>
              Engineers need to work fast and efficiently. Every second of time is crucial; the need
              to produce results quickly is essential. For this reason, it was considered early on
              that aesthetical transitions would be used sparingly, as not to delay the user in
              their progression through a task&mdash;particularly when most tasks are repetitive.
              The quickest way to carry out a task is normally the best way for the user.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the geometry import, I produced a drag-and-drop interface to make it as easy as
              possible for the user to select the appropriate STEP file. Alternatively, users can
              use the <em>Browse Files</em> function.

            <h3>UI design</h3>
            <p>
              I produced colour palettes, typographic styles, form components, layout and grid
              spacing rules that would then be used in the development phase.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rafinex were keen to maintain their brand of blue as the primary colour, so I selected
              a complimenting secondary colour to partner with this. I also created tones for each
              of the user feedback states that were going to be implemented: <em>information</em>,
              <em>success</em>, <em>warning</em> and <em>error</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Drawing upon previous experience in recognising that colours with varying opacities
              can lead to visual problems in build, I ensured all colours were opaque.

              High-fidelity wireframes produced in the UX stage made it a relatively straightforward
              process to apply subtle uses of colour to the <em>All Simulations</em> listing. Given
              the complexity of this table and the main workflow screens, I felt it was paramount to
              create a minimalist and contemporary interface using splashes of colour, typefaces
              which were highly legible and an 8px uniform grid that allowed the elements to
              breathe.

          <div class="u-reading">

              For the core application workflow, I decided to home the main user controls in two
              vertically scrollable panels. With the majority of the screen real estate dedicated
              primarily to the 3D model space, it was important for these menus to be compact yet
              remain accessible and legible.
            </p>

            <p>
              Each accordion on the far left opens up an adjacent context menu, which houses
              particular associated controls. Users can perform a wide range of tasks such as: apply
              forces to their 3D model, apply boundary conditions and view topology optimised
              results data.

            <h3>Frontend development</h3>
            <p>
              I created HTML and Sass templates for components that make up the core of the UI:
              forms, call to actions, accordions, modals, data tables and more. A partial core
              workflow can be viewed below, as well as a video recording of the main user workflow
              being demonstrated.
            </p>

            <p>
              I created reusable, modular components and adopted the BEM (Block Element Modifier)
              class naming convention. This ensures elements are named semantically and minimises
              the risk of class naming conflicts with other parts of the codebase.
            </p>

            <p>
              As of today, some features are currently being developed such as the central toolbar
              and its controls, but the fundamental elements are in place.
            </p>

            <p>Möbius is being used today by businesses in the automotive and engineering sectors, with high levels of success.</p>
