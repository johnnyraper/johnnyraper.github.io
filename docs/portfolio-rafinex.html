            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
              Rafinex' SaaS product, Möbius, is among the most advanced topology optimisation
              technology on the market. Möbius generates robust, reliable and safe components in
              high-performance industries that are fit for reality and remain safe.

            <h3>UX design</h3>
            <p>
              As the lead UX/UI designer, I worked with the holistic team at Rafinex and understood
              the existing product platform, its features and what needed to be overhauled for the
              first release to market. With experience in product design and development in my
              previous role, I had the confidence and knowhow to create a compelling and intuitive
              product.
            </p>

            <p>
              My first foray into the world of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) involved analysing
              similar products and drawing conclusions from these in their approach to user
              interface design, level of intuition and functionality.
            </p>

            <p>
              I carried out a small but challenging task of what an FEA Engineer would conduct in
              his/her day-to-day operations, and was instructed to perform the same task using two
              different pieces of software, namely OnScale Solve and SimScale. I did this to deepen
              my understanding of GUI functions and aesthetics in this domain. I also read
              whitepapers and read lots of user documentation around FEA so that I could absorb as
              much information as possible, which would later provide validation for certain UI
              decisions.
            </p>

            <p>In my research, three things struck me:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                There is a common theme of existing packages in the industry, which feel antiquated.
              </li>
              <li>
                Most packages are functionally rich, performant and comprehensive, yet are poorly
                designed, from a UX point of view.
              </li>
              <li>Finding functions is difficult, and performing basic tasks can be unwieldy.</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="portfolio__callout">
              I was passionate about creating something beautiful, organic and user-centric. I
              realised the importance of combining technical functionality while fulfilling the
              business need for a modern software application.
            </p>

            <p>
              In terms of user discovery, I conducted interviews with relevant internal stakeholders
              to ascertain new product requirements for the typical user persona (an advanced
              engineer). I then collated this information into a report, and drew the key topics
              into a spreadsheet.
            </p>
          </div>

          <img

            src="assets/rafinex/discovery.png"

          />

          <div class="u-reading">
            <p>
              Then, I produced a series of low-fidelity wireframes according to a technical schema
              established by the CTO. I did this so that ideas for elements, panels and dialogues
              could be envisioned conceptually, before moving to high-fidelity designs.
            </p>

            <p>
              I elected to use a table layout for the <em>All Simulations</em> view due to the high
              level of information required per simulation. The additional requirement of filters
              also led to a conscious decision to display data in a table, given that filtered table
              rows can be added and removed easily.
            </p>

            <p>These wireframes are set out as below:</p>

              Once a consensus was reached on low-fidelity wireframes, I produced a series of
              high-fidelity wireframes as per below. I also created an interactive prototype to

              Engineers need to work fast and efficiently. Every second of time is crucial; the need
              to produce results quickly is essential. For this reason, it was considered early on
              that aesthetical transitions would be used sparingly, as not to delay the user in
              their progression through a task&mdash;particularly when most tasks are repetitive.
              The quickest way to carry out a task is normally the best way for the user.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the geometry import, I crafted a drag-and-drop interface to make it as easy as
              possible for the user to select the appropriate STEP file. Alternatively, users can
              use the <em>Browse Files</em> function.

            <h3>UI design and design system</h3>
            <p>
              I established a fundamental and consistent design system, which enabled consistent
              rhythm and aesthetics across every screen to be achieved, as well as alluding to
              Rafinex' corporate brand. I produced colour palettes, typographic styles, form
              components, layout and grid spacing rules that would later be carried forward into
              development.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rafinex were keen to maintain their brand of blue as the primary colour, so I selected
              a complimenting secondary colour to partner with this. I also created tones for each
              of the user feedback states that were going to be implemented: <em>information</em>,
              <em>success</em>, <em>warning</em> and <em>error</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Drawing upon previous experience in recognising that colours with varying opacities
              can lead to visual problems in build, I ensured all colours were opaque.

              High-fidelity wireframes produced in the UX stage made it relatively straightforward
              to apply subtle uses of colour to the <em>All Simulations</em> listing. Given the
              complexity of this table and the main workflow screens, I felt it was paramount to
              create a minimalist and contemporary interface using splashes of colour, legible
              typefaces and an 8px uniform grid that allowed the elements to breathe.

              For the core application workflow, I decided to contain the main user controls in two
              vertically scrollable panels. With the majority of the screen real estate dedicated to
              the 3D model space, it was important for these menus to be compact yet remain
              accessible.
            </p>

            <p>
              Each accordion on the far left opens up an adjacent context menu, which houses
              particular associated controls. Users can perform a wide range of tasks such as: apply
              forces to their 3D model, apply boundary conditions and view topology optimised
              results.

              I created HTML and Sass templates for components that make up the core of the UI:
              forms, call to actions, accordions, modals, data tables and more. A partial core
              workflow can be viewed below, as well as a video recording of the main user workflow
              being demonstrated.

            <p>
              I created reusable, modular components and adopted the BEM (Block Element Modifier)
              class naming convention. This ensures elements are named semantically and minimises
              the risk of class naming conflicts with other parts of the codebase.
            </p>

            <p>
              As of today, some features are currently being developed such as the central toolbar
              and its controls, but the fundamental elements are in place.
