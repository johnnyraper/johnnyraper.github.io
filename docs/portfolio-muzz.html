          <h2>UX Discovery, UX Design and UI Design : Muzz</h2>

          <h3>Intro</h3>
          <p>
            As part of Muzz' interview process for a Product Design role, I was set a challenge to
            solve a complex UX problem. This comprised of product thinking, UX and UI design. The
            exercise tested fundamental principles of a typical UX/UI role; first I needed to
            understand Muzz' users &amp; their needs, followed by crafting a considered and
            pixel-perfect user interface design. The challenge was deliberately open-ended to
            allow for maximum creativity.
          </p>

          <h3>The Brief</h3>

          <p>
            Muzz is a mobile app connecting Muslims worldwide through dating experiences. I was
            asked to wireframe and design a new feature around speed dating that would enable
            potential two matches to be paired for a short interaction (e.g. a video call) before
            giving them the ability to choose whether they want to match.
          </p>

          <h3>Research into the Domain</h3>

          <h4>Approach</h4>

          <p>
            In order to fully understand the company, the market and identify the critical design
            problem that needed to be solved, I took the following approach:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Researched how other dating apps are supporting online speed dating and which of
              these have a "speed dating" feature already.
            </li>
            <li>
              Downloaded Muzz and created an account to familiarise myself with the app, and
              consider where the new feature would be located.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Business Strategy and Growth</h4>

          <p>I also:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Identified the risks associated to the app.</li>
            <li>
              Created plans for monetisation techniques, to ensure that this feature would be able
              to create new revenue streams for the business.
            </li>
            <li>Decided on a name for the new feature.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Deliverables</h4>

          <p>I created the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              UX: Low-fidelity wireframes to convey information architecture and to achieve the
              correct layout.
            </li>
            <li>
              UI: High-fidelity designs to demonstrate how the new feature might look and feel,
              which conformed to the existing brand and app. The goal was to specify this to an
              appropriate level of detail such that an engineer would be able to build this
              without further clarification.
            </li>
            <li>Prototype walkthrough to demonstrate the feature interactively.</li>
            <li>
              Design System of components with instances/variants of each component, so that there
              was a single source of truth for each element.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I also wrote a report to explain how the new feature solves the design problem,
            detailing my thought process and design decisions made.
          </p>
